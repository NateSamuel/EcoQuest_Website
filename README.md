## Project summary

Unlike traditional educational tools that may struggle to maintain engagement, EcoQuest utilises the power of gamification-incorporating elements such as quizzes, achievements, and progress tracking-to make learning about climate change both enjoyable and impactful while fostering a deeper understanding of climate change, conservation, and sustainability. 
The feedback mechanism educates users on the impact of their choices, promoting responsible behaviour.

## Individual Contribution

I learned a lot from this project, particularly using Figma, React.js, and GitHub/Git (in a project scenario collaboratively) for the first time. I focused on front-end design, and appreciated my teammatesâ€™ support as I became more proficient in React.js.
In the second part of the project, I worked extensively on prototyping in Figma. Andrew and I created options for A/B testing, and I developed the MVP-2 prototype and two MVP-3 prototypes, with Krisztina providing valuable feedback and alterations to the final MVP-3 prototype. 
For MVP-2, I implemented the character selection and intro page with the added help of Krisztina's code reviews. 
For MVP-3, I handled the main CSS changes with Volodymyr.  I provided instruction and review to Volodymyr for his additions in order for our work to be as close to the prototype as possible, and successfully created responsive grid layouts. I also developed the map feature for MVP-3 and it is the part of the project I am happiest being able to implement. Also, all team members worked together to debug this final iteration, which felt really collaborative and good.
For other parts of the project
I created and distributed final user surveys (CSI, SUS, and UMUX) to my colleagues at work to aid in evaluating the project after they played the game. 
I designed all logos, imagery, and map graphics to maintain a cohesive "adventure game" style.
I also documented meeting minutes throughout for the team which aided the collaborative process, please see the additional files for reference.
For the report I worked on the design and prototyping sections, with the aid of Volodymyr on the design section to make sure I had got the tech stack right for each part of the app.
